## Dependence
- TensorFlow 1.4
- OpenCV 3.3
- Python 3

The code is tested under Ubuntu 16.04.

## How it works

There are three major steps:

1. Face detection. A face detector is adopted to provide a face box containing a human face. Then the face box is expanded and transformed to a square to suit the needs of later steps.

2. Facial landmark detection. A custom trained facial landmark detector based on TensorFlow is responsible for output 68 facial landmarks.

3. Pose estimation. Once we got the 68 facial landmarks, a mutual PnP algorithms is adopted to calculate the pose.

## Miscellaneous
- The marks is detected frame by frame, which result in small variance between adjacent frames. This makes the pose unstaible. A Kalman filter is used to solve this problem, you can draw the original pose to observe the difference.

- The 3D model of face comes from OpenFace, you can find the original file [here](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/blob/master/lib/local/LandmarkDetector/model/pdms/In-the-wild_aligned_PDM_68.txt).
